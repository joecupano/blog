# Short Wave Listening with Software Defined Radio

**Posted on March 31, 2018**

## Background

My interest and career in technology originated with a gift from an adult cousin when I was a child. That gift was a Hallicrafters S-120A Shortwave Radio Receiver. My cousin setup a 50 feet long end fed wire antenna down the length of my backyard tacked against a couple of trees about 12 feet up in the air. The wire fed straight into my bedroom snaked through the window jam. My cousin then showed me how to use the radio, tuned in a few stations, and before I knew I had the [Short Wave Listening (SWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_listening) bug. It was the early 1970’s and there were plenty of stations to tune into – broadcast, utility, amateur radio, aviation, etc.

I had a couple of years of fun with that radio until one night I was woken up by the flash of an early summer lightening storm and then the sight and smell of smoke coming out of the back of my beloved Hallicrafters radio. Fortunately my uncle who was an avid collector of all things gave me a [circa 1958 Philco Trans-World Portable T-9](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/philco_t_9_code_12_126.html) which kept me going with my SWL activities – as long as I had enough batteries. Then I found a [1937 Philco model 37-610 Table radio](http://www.tuberadioland.com/philco-37-610-big_bullet_mainl.html) from a local antique store which served me well. All the time I still missed my S-120A which I kept for a longtime hoping I could get it fixed.

But when the 80’s arrived I got into computers, got my Amateur Radio license, went to college, built a career in technology, and live life. My SWL activities faded into memories and my Amateur Radio activity was largely in hiatus into the early ’00s. Then about five years ago I began playing with early software defined radios (SDR) available as kits and projects that re-purposed DVB TV Tuners into VHF/UHF receivers. But it was too bleeding edge for me and I was losing patience
