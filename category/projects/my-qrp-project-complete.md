# My QRP Project Complete

Almost two years ago I did a post on a $15 CW transceiver you could build called the Pixie II CW QRP transceiver. As mentioned I bought the kit but only recently had a chance to finally put it together and get it on the air.

## So if this is your first kit, here are some essential tools to help you get the most enjoyment out of kit building.

When it comes to desoldering I prefer using a [vacuum solder sucker](https://www.amazon.com/Tabiger-Solder-Desoldering-Sucker-Remover/dp/B0777LMVTT) over using [solder wick](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12580051). For me it is easier to wield the solder pull in one hand while applying the iron to the part to be desoldered than use a wick.

Two other essential tools to make kit building enjoyable include [helping hands vices](https://www.amazon.com/PanaVise-Model-201-Junior-Miniature/dp/B000B61D22) and [lighted head mounted magnifier lenses](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=head+magnifiers&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ahead+magnifiers). Of course there are many tools out there people will suggest but I just wanted to cover the ones you will use all the time without breaking the bank if you have a limited budget.

## As for building the kit.

Since the kit did not come with assembly instructions, I searched the web to see who else has built a Pixie and see what experiences they posted. For that I went with [the article I suggested in my previous post](https://web.archive.org/web/20090416095958/http://www.coffeepower.net/ham/pixieII/pixieII.htm). The Pixie I built is tuned for 40 meters on the QRP frequency of 7040 KHz.

I decided to go with building the kit inside an Altoids tin at first but it did not have enough real estate for how and where I wanted to mount my connectors and switch. So I went with a cigar tin that was not as deep but had more length and width. Here are a few pictures.

As you view the tin case from left to right you will see a SPST toggle switch for power, a stereo connector for audio, a stereo connector for a key, and a RCA female connector for the antenna.

Though the audio is mono, I went with a stereo connector since they are designed to accept mono and stereo male connectors. So know when you connect a stereo headphone to this you will only hear audio from one side. I went with a stereo connector for the key since male stereo is what I have on all my keys.

For the antenna connection I went retro rather than using the evolving standard of SMA connections for small RF devices. Personally, I am tired of spending alot of money on pigtails for SMA to SO-239. It is cheaper to go with a Motorola female for the antenna connector as found in older radios from 60s and then a single adapter to go from RCA female to SO-239.

The PCB sits inside the tin case with plenty of electrical tape on the copper side to insure no shorting. The PCB floats freely so I just push it to one side to make space for the 9V battery.
