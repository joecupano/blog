# If there is no business, there is nothing to secure

> If there is no business, there is nothing to secure.

A quote I’ve made many times to security professionals to remind them where they are in the “food chain.” You must evolve or change careers.  
Remember…

- IT Security is about IT, Information Security is about Information
- IT is just a tool to enable the business.
- Information is Intellectual Property owned by the Business.
- Only when IT is considered business intellectual property providing measurable value as a market differentiation does the business become pragmatic when it comes to outsourcing pieces of IT.

While IT becomes condensed, commodotized, and outsourced, information continues to explode in size needing to be available everywhere ideally controlled and accounted for. Security needs to follow the information. This is where the challenges are and is where growth and $$$ opportunities exist for security professionals as long as they remember…… If there is no business, there is nothing to secure.  
For what it’s worth,

– Joe
