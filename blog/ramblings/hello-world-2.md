# Have I got a story to tell you . . .

**Posted on August 24, 2014**

I don’t think anyone noticed my little soap box on the inter-webs has been down since January 2014. In fact the only people who may have noticed were the people mistakenly typing cupano.com instead of cupano.it to get to a winery site. That was because I have re-direct for cupano.com pointing to the winery but that is a story for another time.

The real story starts with my EMAIL provider of twenty years giving me four hour notice that they were going out of business and shutting the servers down that night.

We will get to that story but first I need to get moved into my new digs here with this hosting provider. Oh yes, the EMAIL provider led to an issue with the old hosting provider I had.

Stay tuned.
