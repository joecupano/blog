![My First Solo – Guess the Song](/blog/assets/school-1024x825.jpg)

Born in [New Jersey](http://weirdnj.com/) then moved to [New York](http://www.weirdus.com/states/new_york/index.php) in my teenage years. I could have been a professional saxophone player having played since childhood but technology won out in the end.

I credit the corruption of a potential music career to a much older cousin of mine, David Jablonski. David was an eclectic individual with a diversity of interests. One summer when I was about eight he gave me shortwave radio for my birthday and setup a long thin wire antenna in the yard. I was immediately hooked into [Shortwave Listening (SWL.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_listening) When I heard a far away radio station I would send them a letter with time and frequency I heard them on hoping they would send a [QSL card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card) in return to add to my collection.

When I moved to New York, I met an [Amateur Radio](http://www.arrl.org/what-is-ham-radio) club and got my [FCC Amateur Radio license.](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/amateur-radio-service) Within four years I got my Extra class license (NE2Z) which included me having to demonstrate ability to copy [Morse Code (CW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) at twenty words per minute. (Yes, I still do CW at speed.) With the first computer I owned and built ([Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81)), I would do [AFSK communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying#Audio_FSK) over [2 Meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-meter_band) using the load/save cassette ports with another Amateur Radio owning similar kit. This was a precursor to the standardization of [AX.25 v2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AX.25) for [Packet Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_radio). My first “hack” was sending his computer commands to fire up the thermal printer scaring the hell out of him. By this time, saxophone was not going to be a career path.

Once I got my AAS in EET from [SUNY Orange](https://sunyorange.edu/), a good friend of mine, John Katonah N2ETY, helped me get into the business of component-level computer repair — Apple, Commodore, IBM, etc. Since working on cars helped put me through college and I thought there would be a convergence with computers so I also ended up getting a [GM certification on the Computer Command Control Systems](https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/historical-brochures/Innovation_and_Technology/GM-Introduces-CCC.pdf). Computer repair was interesting times until the average pin count on chips got too dense to work with and the world went to board-level repair (swaps.) Outside of work, my friends and I ran a few [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) with “[The Particle Board II and III](http://bbslist.textfiles.com/914/)” the most notable.

I went from being certified hardware technician on multiple compute platforms to getting into network starting with [Novell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetWare) certification, [Token Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring), and TCP/IP networks and then when I got married started work with enterprise systems and an emerging area called security. [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cupano/) can fill you on on the rest of my professional career.

My computer interests and career put Amateur Radio on the backburner for just over a decade. While I missed out on the “heyday” of Packet Radio, a friend of mine, [John Champa K8OCL](http://www.arrl.org/news/john-champa-k8ocl-sk), asked me in the early naught years to join a [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/) Technology Task Force on [High-Speed Multimedia radio](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/About%20ARRL/Committee%20Reports/2006/July/BOD06-2%20CTO%20Annex%20C%20rev2.pdf) investigating the next generation in digital communications within Amateur Radio. Happy to see over the years since that task force disbanded developments in [mesh networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) born from it.

Hacking for good has been part of my core whether it manifest as hardware, software, or social. Over the past decade I have supported the biennial [Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE)](https://hope.net/) conference whether it be running an [special event station](/category/amateur-radio//hope-xi-repeater.md) or conducting a [workshop](hopexii-workshop/index.md).

Today you can find me spending my leisure time with [microcontrollers](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/ttgo-lora32-sx1276-arduino-ide/) and 3D printers engaging hacker and [makerspaces](http://squidwrench.org/) working on [open source projects](https://github.com/hudsonvalleydigitalnetwork/hasviolet) the reflect the convergence of my RF, hacker, and maker interests.

Peace, Health, and Happiness to you and yours!
